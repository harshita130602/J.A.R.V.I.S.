# J.A.R.V.I.S. 

**J.A.R.V.I.S.** is a voice activated desktop assistant which is built by using Python. It allows you to navigate any site, send email to anyone from your email account etc, view reddit of any valid subreddit. In this, Google's Text-To-Speech library have been used to process voice input. Many other packages have been used too. Take a look at [requirements.txt](https://github.com/harshita130602/J.A.R.V.I.S./blob/master/requirements.txt) file in order to install all the pre-requisites before running this code on your system.

## Run code in your system 
If you are a linux user, install the say command using:
```
sudo apt-get install gnustep-gui-runtime
```
In order to install all the pre-requisites at once, install pip3 and then type the following command in your system:
* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


Now, type the following commands in your terminal in order to run the program on your system: 
* `git clone https://github.com/harshita130602/J.A.R.V.I.S.`
